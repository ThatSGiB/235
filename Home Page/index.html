        <p id="Main_Paragraph">My name is Spencer Betze, I'm from Marlton New Jersey, and am a NMID major.  I love video games, D&D, drawing and playing the drums.  I hope to learn more about how web development works, which can be useful for learning how to make servers and such for game design, which is what I would like to do for a career.  I'm not in the game design program, but that is something I would like to do, but I am also interested in doing game animations.</p>
